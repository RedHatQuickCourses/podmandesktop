[#download-install-windows]
== Installing Podman Desktop on Windows

Installing Podman Desktop on Windows involves downloading an executable installer and following a standard wizard-driven installation process.

[#technical-explanation-windows]
=== Technical Explanation: Windows Installation

For Windows, Podman Desktop is provided as an executable (`.exe`) installer. This installer handles placing all necessary application files, creating Start Menu shortcuts, and performing any required system registrations. The installer usually prompts for administrative privileges, which are essential for system-level changes. A key prerequisite for Podman Desktop on Windows is the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL 2), which provides the environment for the underlying Podman engine. While the Podman Desktop installer itself might assist in detecting or even suggesting WSL 2 installation, ensuring WSL 2 is configured correctly is vital for the Podman machine functionality.

[NOTE]
Upon its first launch, Podman Desktop on Windows will guide you through the initial setup, including verifying or assisting with WSL 2 installation and creating the Podman machine. This process is crucial for enabling container capabilities and is detailed in the <<initial-setup-windows,Initial Setup on Windows>> section.#  Download and installation process via installer

= Installing Podman Desktop on macOS

This section guides you through the process of downloading and installing Red Hat Build of Podman Desktop on macOS, a seamless experience designed to get you up and running with container management quickly. We'll cover obtaining the installer, performing the installation, and verifying the initial setup.

== Download and Installation Process via Installer

Red Hat Build of Podman Desktop for macOS is distributed as a `.dmg` (Disk Image) file, a standard package format for macOS applications. This method simplifies the installation to a straightforward drag-and-drop operation, familiar to most macOS users. The `.dmg` file typically contains the application bundle (`.app` file) and often includes a shortcut to the Applications folder for convenience.

When you install Podman Desktop using the installer, it sets up the necessary application files in your `Applications` directory. While the core application is installed this way, Podman Desktop itself relies on the Podman engine to manage containers. On macOS, this usually involves the creation and management of a Podman machine, which is a lightweight Linux virtual machine that hosts the Podman engine. This machine is typically managed by Podman Desktop automatically after the initial application installation, but understanding its role is crucial for advanced configurations and troubleshooting.

=== Hands-on Activity: Installing Podman Desktop on macOS

Follow these steps to download and install Red Hat Build of Podman Desktop on your macOS system.

**Objective:** Successfully download the Podman Desktop installer and install the application on macOS.

**Estimated Time:** 5-10 minutes

**Procedure:**

.  **Access the Official Download Page:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to the official Podman Desktop download page. For Red Hat Build of Podman Desktop, this is typically found on the Red Hat Developers site or the main Podman Desktop website.
    A common URL pattern might look like `https://podman-desktop.io/downloads` or a similar Red Hat-branded page.

    _Figure 1: Example of a macOS download button (actual appearance may vary)_

.  **Download the Installer File:**
    Click the download link. Your browser will start downloading the `.dmg` file to your default downloads folder (e.g., `~/Downloads`). The file size can vary, but typically it's a few hundred megabytes.

    [source,bash]
    ----
    # Example command to check downloaded file (adjust filename as needed)
    ls ~/Downloads/Podman*Desktop*.dmg
    ----

.  **Open the `.dmg` File:**
    Once the download is complete, navigate to your downloads folder and double-click the `Podman Desktop-*-mac.dmg` file. This will mount the disk image, opening a new Finder window that usually displays the Podman Desktop application icon and an alias to your Applications folder.

    _Figure 2: Podman Desktop .dmg window showing application icon and Applications folder_

.  **Install Podman Desktop:**
    Drag the "Podman Desktop" application icon from the mounted `.dmg` window into the "Applications" folder shortcut also present in that window. This copies the application bundle to your system's `Applications` directory.

    [source,bash]
    ----
    # Internally, this is similar to copying the application bundle
    # to /Applications, but the drag-and-drop is the standard macOS method.
    ----

    If prompted, you may need to authenticate with your administrator password.

.  **Eject the Disk Image:**
    After the copy operation is complete, you can unmount the disk image. To do this, drag the "Podman Desktop" disk image icon from your desktop or Finder sidebar to the Trash, or right-click the icon and select "Eject 'Podman Desktop'".

    [source,bash]
    ----
    # Command-line equivalent for ejecting a mounted volume (example)
    diskutil unmount "/Volumes/Podman Desktop"
    ----

.  **Launch Podman Desktop for the First Time:**
    Open your `Applications` folder (you can use Finder or press `Cmd+Shift+A` from a Finder window) and double-click the "Podman Desktop" application icon.

    The first time you launch it, macOS might ask for confirmation that you want to open an application downloaded from the internet. Click "Open" to proceed.

    Podman Desktop will then start and guide you through the initial setup, which typically involves creating or connecting to a Podman machine. This crucial step is covered in the subsequent section "Initial Setup and Podman machine creation".

**Troubleshooting Tip:** If you encounter issues during installation, ensure you have sufficient disk space and that your macOS version meets the minimum system requirements. A common issue is a security warning preventing the app from opening; you can often resolve this by going to `System Settings > Privacy & Security` and explicitly allowing the app.

You have now successfully downloaded and installed Red Hat Build of Podman Desktop on your macOS system. The next step is to configure your Podman machine to enable container operations.
