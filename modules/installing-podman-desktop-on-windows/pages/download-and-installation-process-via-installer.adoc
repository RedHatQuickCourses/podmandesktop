#  Download and installation process via installer

= Download and Installation Process via Installer

This section guides you through the process of downloading and installing Red Hat Build of Podman Desktop using its dedicated installer for macOS and Windows operating systems. The installer simplifies the setup, including the initial configuration of the Podman engine and the creation of a Podman machine, which is essential for running containers.

== Installing Podman Desktop on macOS

On macOS, Podman Desktop is typically installed using a Disk Image (`.dmg`) file. This method provides a straightforward graphical installation experience, integrating Podman Desktop seamlessly into your applications.

=== Technical Explanation

The installation process for Podman Desktop on macOS involves downloading a `.dmg` file, which is a disk image containing the application. When mounted, this disk image typically presents an interface allowing you to drag the Podman Desktop application icon into your Applications folder. This action copies the application executable and its associated resources to your system.

Upon the first launch of Podman Desktop, it performs initial setup tasks. A crucial step here is the creation of a "Podman machine." Since Podman Desktop provides a graphical interface for managing containers, it needs a backend container engine. On macOS, Podman runs its Linux-based engine inside a lightweight virtual machine. The installer or the first-launch wizard will guide you through creating this Podman machine, which involves downloading and configuring a minimal Linux distribution VM (often based on Fedora CoreOS or a similar lightweight image). This VM is where your containers will actually run, managed by the Podman engine.

=== Hands-on Activity: Installing Podman Desktop on macOS

Follow these steps to download and install Podman Desktop on your macOS system.

. Navigate to the official Red Hat Build of Podman Desktop download page. You can usually find this by searching for "Podman Desktop download" or visiting `https://podman-desktop.io/downloads`.
. Locate the download link for macOS and click it to download the `.dmg` installer file.
+
[NOTE]
The file name will typically be something like `podman-desktop-*-mac.dmg`.

. Once the download is complete, open the downloaded `.dmg` file.
+
This will mount the disk image and open a new Finder window, usually showing the Podman Desktop application icon and a shortcut to your Applications folder.

. Drag the `Podman Desktop.app` icon into the `Applications` folder shortcut displayed in the window.
+
This action copies the application to your Applications directory.

. Eject the Podman Desktop disk image from your Finder sidebar or desktop by dragging its icon to the Trash (which will change to an eject symbol).
. Open your Applications folder and double-click the `Podman Desktop` icon to launch the application.
. Upon its first launch, Podman Desktop will guide you through an initial setup wizard. This wizard will typically:
    *   Detect if a Podman engine is present.
    *   Prompt you to create a new Podman machine if one doesn't exist. Click through the prompts to accept the default settings for the Podman machine (e.g., CPU, memory, disk size).
    *   Download the necessary files for the Podman machine and start it.
+
[TIP]
Ensure you have an active internet connection during this initial setup as it needs to download VM images.

. Once the Podman machine is successfully created and started, the Podman Desktop dashboard will appear, indicating that the installation and initial setup are complete.

== Installing Podman Desktop on Windows

Installing Podman Desktop on Windows typically involves using an executable installer (`.exe`) package. This installer automates the process, including checks for prerequisites like Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL 2) and the setup of the Podman machine.

=== Technical Explanation

The Windows installer for Podman Desktop (`.exe` file) is a self-contained package that guides you through the installation steps. When you run the installer, it performs several critical functions:

*   **File Extraction**: It extracts the necessary application files to your system, usually within the `Program Files` directory.
*   **System Integration**: It creates shortcuts in your Start Menu and handles system-level configurations.
*   **Prerequisite Checks**: The installer will often check for or guide you through setting up essential prerequisites. For Windows, the most critical prerequisite is *Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL 2)*. Podman Desktop relies on WSL 2 to run a lightweight Linux virtual machine where the Podman engine operates. If WSL 2 is not enabled or properly configured, the installer might prompt you to enable it or provide instructions.
*   **Podman Machine Creation**: Similar to macOS, upon the first launch, or sometimes integrated into the installer's final steps, Podman Desktop will assist you in creating a "Podman machine." This machine is a dedicated WSL 2 distribution that hosts the Podman engine, providing the necessary Linux environment for running containers. The wizard will configure the VM's resources (CPU, memory, disk).

== Installing Podman Desktop on macOS

The macOS installer for Podman Desktop leverages the standard `.dmg` package format, providing a straightforward drag-and-drop installation experience. This process places the application within your Applications folder, making it readily accessible.

=== Technical Explanation

On macOS, applications are commonly distributed as `.dmg` files. When you open a `.dmg` file, it mounts a virtual disk image that typically contains the application bundle (`.app`) and a shortcut to the Applications folder. The installation process involves dragging the application bundle into the Applications folder. This action copies the application and its associated resources to a standard location, making it discoverable by macOS and available to all users. Podman Desktop on macOS also manages a dedicated Podman machine, a lightweight virtual machine that hosts the actual Podman engine, ensuring container isolation and consistent behavior. The initial launch after installation will guide you through setting this up.

[[windows-installer]]
== Installing Podman Desktop on Windows

For Windows, Red Hat Build of Podman Desktop provides an `.exe` installer that guides you through the setup process. A critical component for containerization on Windows is the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL 2), which Podman Desktop integrates with seamlessly.

=== Technical Explanation

The Windows installer for Podman Desktop is an executable (`.exe`) that automates the installation of the application, typically placing it in the `Program Files` directory. On Windows, Podman Desktop leverages WSL 2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux version 2) to run the Podman engine in a lightweight Linux virtual machine. This integration provides a full Linux kernel environment, ensuring compatibility and performance for container workloads. The installer for Podman Desktop will often check for WSL 2 prerequisites and may even offer to install or upgrade it if needed. The core application runs natively on Windows, providing a graphical user interface, while the heavy lifting of container execution happens within the WSL 2 environment.
