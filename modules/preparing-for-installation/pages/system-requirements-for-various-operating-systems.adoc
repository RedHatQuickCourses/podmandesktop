 ```bash
 free -h
 ```
 Look for the "Mem" line under the "total" column to see your installed RAM in a human-readable format.

. To check free disk space:
 ```bash
 df -h /
 ```
 This command shows the disk usage for your root filesystem. If your container storage resides on a different partition (e.g., `/var`), adjust the command accordingly (e.g., `df -h /var`).

. To check if the Podman engine is installed and running:
 ```bash
 podman --version
 systemctl status podman
 ```
 The `podman --version` command will display the installed Podman CLI version. If it returns an error, Podman is not installed.
 The `systemctl status podman` command will show the status of the `podman` systemd service. Ensure it indicates "active (running)". If it's not running, you may need to start and enable it: `sudo systemctl start podman` and `sudo systemctl enable podman`.#  System requirements for various operating systems

    *   **RHEL/Linux:** Open a terminal and run `df -h /`.

.  **Windows Specific - Verify WSL 2 and Virtualization:**
    *   Open PowerShell as an administrator.
    *   Run `wsl --status`. Ensure "Default Version: 2" is shown. If not, refer to Microsoft's documentation to enable and update WSL2.
    *   To check for virtualization in BIOS/UEFI, you usually need to restart your computer and enter the firmware settings. Look for "Virtualization Technology," "Intel VT-x," or "AMD-V" and ensure it's enabled. (This step requires a reboot, so proceed if unsure or after saving your work).

.  **RHEL/Linux Specific - Verify Podman Engine Installation:**
    *   Open a terminal and run `podman --version`. If Podman is not found or the version is old, you may need to install or update it:
        ```bash
        sudo dnf install podman -y
        ```
    *   To verify that `systemd` user services for Podman are running:
        ```bash
        systemctl --user status podman.socket
        ```
        It should show `active (running)`.

==== Verification:

Once you have completed these checks, compare your system's specifications against the requirements listed above.

*   If your system meets or exceeds the requirements, you are ready to proceed with the installation.
*   If your system does not meet certain requirements (e.g., insufficient RAM, older OS version, WSL2 not enabled), you will need to address these issues before attempting to install Podman Desktop. Consulting official documentation or upgrading hardware/software may be necessary.
