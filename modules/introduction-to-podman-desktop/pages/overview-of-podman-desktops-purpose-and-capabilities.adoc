    *   Configure settings for installed container engines (memory, CPU, disk, proxies).
    *   Connect to and manage multiple container engines, local or remote.

*   **Registry Configuration:**
    *   Add and configure connections to public and private container registries.
    *   Manage authentication credentials (image pull secrets) for secure access to registries.

*   **Network Configuration:**
    *   Inspect existing container networks.
    *   Configure network settings for containers, including port forwarding.

*   **Kubernetes and OpenShift Integration:**
    *   Seamlessly deploy containerized applications to local Kubernetes clusters (e.g., Kind, Minikube).
    *   Connect to and manage remote Kubernetes or OpenShift clusters.
    *   Generate Kubernetes manifests (`YAML`) from running containers or pods, easing the transition from local development to cluster deployment.

*   **Extensions Marketplace:**
    *   Extend Podman Desktop's functionality through an integrated marketplace of extensions. These can include tools for security scanning, specific Kubernetes integrations, and other development utilities.

*   **Status Monitoring and Troubleshooting:**
    *   Provides a dashboard to monitor the status of running containers and engines.
    *   Offers diagnostic tools and access to logs to assist in troubleshooting common issues.

By centralizing these critical functions into an intuitive graphical interface, Podman Desktop empowers developers and operations teams to work more efficiently and effectively with container technologies, regardless of their preferred operating system or level of CLI expertise.

= Overview of Red Hat Build of Podman Desktop

Podman Desktop is a graphical user interface (GUI) application that provides a unified, intuitive experience for managing containers, pods, images, and volumes locally, and interacting with Kubernetes environments. It simplifies the complex world of containerization for developers and system administrators, enabling them to focus on building and deploying applications rather than wrestling with command-line interfaces for every operation.

== What is Podman Desktop?

Red Hat Build of Podman Desktop is an open-source, cross-platform tool designed to bridge the gap between local container development and deployment to various container orchestration platforms, including Kubernetes and OpenShift. While powerful command-line tools like `podman` are essential, Podman Desktop offers a visual abstraction layer that makes everyday container operations more accessible, discoverable, and manageable.

It acts as a central hub for multiple container engines (e.g., Podman, Docker) and Kubernetes contexts, allowing users to switch seamlessly between them and manage their respective resources from a single application.

== Purpose and Core Capabilities

The primary purpose of Podman Desktop is to enhance developer productivity by providing a user-friendly interface for common container development and management tasks. Its core capabilities include:
